## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Insufficient Disk Space
- Unreal Engine requires significant storage. Ensure you have at least **200 GB of free space** for installation, source builds, and project files.

### 2. Outdated Software Dependencies

  %localappdata%\EpicGamesLauncher\Saved\webcache
  ```

### 5. Build Errors in Source Builds
- Double-check Visual Studio workloads (C++ and Game Development).
- Ensure dependencies are properly downloaded via `Setup.bat`.
- Update Git submodules if necessary:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

### 6. Plugin and Project Compatibility Issues
- Always check version compatibility when importing older projects or plugins into Unreal Engine 5.5.
