## Introduction

### What Is Unreal Engine?

Unreal Engine is a powerful real-time 3D creation platform developed by Epic Games. It is widely used in game development, film, architecture, automotive design, and a variety of other real-time visualization projects. With a robust suite of tools, Unreal Engine allows artists, designers, and programmers to collaborate more efficiently and push visual boundaries.

### Why Unreal Engine 5.5?

The Unreal Engine 5 series introduces revolutionary features such as **Nanite** (virtualized geometry) and **Lumen** (global illumination and reflections), significantly improving efficiency and visual fidelity. Version **5.5** builds upon these advancements by refining performance, adding new tools, and streamlining pipelines, making it one of the most feature-rich and powerful releases to date.
