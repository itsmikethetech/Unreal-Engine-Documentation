# 1.7 Community Tips & Troubleshooting

## Common Issues During Installation

Installing Unreal Engine 5.5 can sometimes present challenges, especially for new users. Below are some of the most common issues and their solutions to help you get started smoothly:

### 1. Missing SDKs
**Problem:**
- Unreal Engine 5.5 requires specific Software Development Kits (SDKs) to compile and build projects, especially for platforms like Android, iOS, and consoles.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Requirements:**
   - Windows: Install the latest Visual Studio (Community Edition is free).
     - Enable "Game Development with C++" and "Desktop Development with C++" during installation.
     - Include optional components such as Windows SDK and MSVC Toolset.
   - Mac: Ensure Xcode is installed and up-to-date.

2. **Android Development:**
   - Install Android Studio and SDK tools.
   - Set environment variables (e.g., `ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME`).
   - Follow Epic's documentation on configuring Android.

3. **iOS Development:**
   - Install Xcode Command Line Tools.
   - Set up provisioning profiles and certificates for Apple builds.

4. **DirectX and Vulkan SDKs:**
   - Ensure DirectX runtime libraries and Vulkan SDKs are up-to-date for rendering.

5. **Restart the Launcher:**
   - After installing missing SDKs, restart the Epic Games Launcher to refresh dependencies.

### 2. Epic Games Launcher Issues
**Problem:**
- Unreal Engine won’t install or update properly.

**Solution:**
- Clear Launcher Cache:
  1. Close the Epic Games Launcher.
  2. Navigate to `%localappdata%\EpicGamesLauncher\Saved` and delete the "webcache" folder.
  3. Restart the launcher.
- Check permissions to ensure the launcher has access to necessary files and directories.
- Disable antivirus/firewall temporarily to rule out interference.

### 3. Plugin Compatibility Errors
**Problem:**
- Custom or third-party plugins may not work after upgrading to Unreal Engine 5.5.

**Solution:**
- Verify plugin compatibility in the Plugin Marketplace.
- Rebuild plugins manually from source code if needed.
- Contact plugin developers for updates.

### 4. Compilation or Packaging Failures
**Problem:**
- Errors occur during build or packaging.

**Solution:**
- Verify Visual Studio or Xcode settings.
- Check output logs (Window > Developer Tools > Output Log).
- Update project dependencies by right-clicking your `.uproject` file and selecting "Generate Visual Studio Project Files."
- Use the "Build Clean" option in the Build menu.

### 5. Crashes and Stability Issues
**Problem:**
- Unreal Editor crashes during startup or runtime.

**Solution:**
- Update GPU drivers (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel).
- Increase virtual memory (pagefile size) in Windows settings.
- Disable unnecessary plugins and re-enable them one by one to isolate issues.
- Use `-d3d11` or `-opengl` launch arguments to test alternate rendering paths.
