# 1.6 Project Creation & Folder Structure

## Creating a New Project in Unreal Engine 5.5
Setting up a new project in Unreal Engine 5.5 is the foundation for any game or interactive experience. The process is streamlined, but there are key considerations to ensure your project is scalable and easy to manage.

### Step 1: Launch Unreal Engine
1. Open the **Epic Games Launcher**.
2. Navigate to the **Unreal Engine** tab.
3. Click the **Launch** button for Unreal Engine 5.5.

### Step 2: Create a New Project
1. When Unreal Engine opens, the **Project Browser** appears.
2. Select the **Games** category to start with a game-based template (other categories, such as **Film/Video**, are available for non-game projects).
3. Choose a Template:
   - **Blank**: Ideal for full customization with no predefined content.
   - **First Person**: Includes a first-person character and gameplay mechanics.
   - **Third Person**: Provides a third-person character template with animations.
   - **Top Down**: Suitable for strategy and RPG games.
   - **Side Scroller**: Designed for 2D/2.5D games.
   - **VR Templates**: Optimized for virtual reality development.

### Step 3: Configure Project Settings
1. **Project Location** - Select the folder where your project will be saved.
2. **Blueprint or C++** - Choose whether to use **Blueprint** scripting, **C++**, or a combination of both. Beginners should start with Blueprint, while advanced developers may prefer C++.
3. **Starter Content** - Decide whether to include Starter Content, which provides materials, textures, and meshes.
4. **Ray Tracing** - Enable or disable ray tracing based on whether you need high-fidelity lighting and reflections.
5. **Target Platform**:
   - **Desktop/Console**: Full graphical fidelity.
   - **Mobile/Tablet**: Optimized for lower performance devices.
6. Click **Create** to generate the project.

## Choosing Templates: Which One is Right for You?
- **Blank**: Recommended for advanced users or custom workflows requiring minimal setup.
- **First Person**: Perfect for FPS games or immersive exploration experiences.
- **Third Person**: Best suited for character-driven games and RPGs.
- **Top Down**: Ideal for strategy games, point-and-click adventures, or dungeon crawlers.
- **Side Scroller**: Excellent for 2D platformers and action games.
- **Virtual Reality**: Preconfigured for VR development, including input and motion-tracking components.
- **Advanced Vehicle** or **Flying**: Tailored for vehicle-based gameplay.

## Recommended Folder Structure for Organization
An organized folder structure is critical for scalability and collaboration. Unreal Engine uses a hierarchical structure in the **Content Browser** to store assets.

### Default Folder Structure
```
Content/
├── Maps/                   // Levels and worlds.
├── Blueprints/             // Blueprint scripts.
├── Materials/              // Materials and shaders.
├── Textures/               // Textures and images.
├── Meshes/                 // Static and skeletal meshes.
├── Animations/             // Animations and rigs.
├── Audio/                  // Sound effects and music.
├── UI/                     // User Interface assets.
├── Effects/                // Particle systems and visual effects.
├── Data/                   // Data tables and curve assets.
├── Widgets/                // UI Widgets (UMG).
└── C++/                    // Source code files (if applicable).
```

### Expanded Recommendations
1. **Separate by Feature**: For complex games, organize folders by features or modules.
   - Example: `Content/CombatSystem/` for combat-related assets.
2. **Keep Naming Consistent**: Use a naming convention such as `BP_` for Blueprints (e.g., `BP_Character`).
3. **Avoid Long Paths**: Unreal Engine has a limit on file path lengths. Keep folder and file names short but descriptive.
4. **Group Similar Assets**: For example, group all assets related to a specific character (meshes, textures, and animations) into a dedicated folder.
5. **Backup Scripts and Plugins**: Maintain backups of custom plugins and scripts outside the main Content folder.

### Example Folder Breakdown for Larger Projects
```
Content/
├── Core/                     // Core systems (GameInstance, GameMode, etc.)
├── Characters/
│   ├── Hero/
│   │   ├── Meshes/
│   │   ├── Animations/
│   │   └── Blueprints/
│   └── Enemies/
├── Environment/
│   ├── Buildings/
│   ├── Props/
│   └── Landscapes/
├── Effects/
│   ├── Particles/
│   ├── Shaders/
│   └── Decals/
├── UI/
│   ├── Widgets/
│   └── Fonts/
└── Audio/
    ├── Music/
    └── SFX/
```

## Tips for Maintaining Organization
1. **Version Control**: Use **Git** or **Perforce** for source control, especially in team environments.
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove unused or duplicate assets periodically.
3. **Folder Locking**: Lock finalized folders to prevent accidental modifications.
4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use prefixes for quick identification:
     - `BP_` - Blueprints
     - `SM_` - Static Meshes
     - `SK_` - Skeletal Meshes
     - `M_` - Materials
     - `T_` - Textures
     - `SFX_` - Sound Effects

## Conclusion
Starting with a well-organized project and folder structure in Unreal Engine 5.5 ensures smooth development and minimizes issues later. Whether you're creating a simple prototype or a full-scale game, following these guidelines will help maintain order and improve collaboration.
