### Step 4: Configure Project Settings

1. **Open Unreal Engine:**
   - Launch Unreal Engine through the Epic Games Launcher.

2. **Create a New Project:**
   - Click on "New Project".
   - Choose a template that suits your project requirement (e.g., Blank, First Person, Third Person).

3. **Set Up Source Control:**
   - Navigate to File > Source Control and select a suitable source control platform (like Git or Perforce) for versioning your project files effectively.

### Step 5: Verifying the Installation

#### Running a Sample Project

1. **Open a Demo Project:**
   - Within Unreal Engine, navigate to the "Samples" section.
   - Open a sample project such as "Starter Content" or "Blueprint Third Person".

2. **Build & Run:**
   - In the toolbar, ensure the platform is set to your operating system, then click 'Play' to run the project.
   - This action will prompt Unreal Engine to compile and execute the basic setup, testing the installation.

3. **Check for Errors:**
   - Monitor the Output Log for any errors or warnings. Proper installation should execute without major errors.
   - If issues arise, check the message details in the Output Log to pinpoint installation or setup problems. 

### Advanced Tips

- **Batch File Optimization for Windows Users:**
  - Add the `UE4Editor-Cmd.exe` location to your system's Environment Variables to run the editor from the command line.
  - This setup is particularly useful for fast-launching projects via terminal commands.

- **Mac Parallel Execution:**
  - Use Xcode’s integrated tools to profile and debug Unreal Engine directly supporting real-time performance adjustments, focusing on Metal compatibility on Mac.
  
- **Visual Studio Code Integration:**
  - For those who prefer VS Code, download the “C/C++ for Visual Studio Code” extension. Configure it to recognize `.uproject` files for quicker navigation and editing within the VS Code ecosystem.
